# osinfo
bash script to show a summary of the system (like neofetch, pfetch etc.)

This should be copied or linked to one of the system /bin/ files like /usr/bin/, then refresh bash by typing 'bash' in the command line.  After this, when you type osinfo it should launch this script in the terminal giving you all the info of the system.  This was written and tested on a Ubuntu system, may also work on other systems if using bash.

This can be added to the .bashrc file to run evertime the terminal is opened similarly to how people use neofetch and pfetch etc.
